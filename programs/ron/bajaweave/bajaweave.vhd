-- Bajaweave: Two Smooth Curvy Sine Lines (Phase-Modulated Carriers)
--
-- Generates two vertical "lines" whose sway travels up / down the screen.
-- The bars themselves stay put horizontally.  Lines are smooth because:
--   * Carrier is a continuous sine wave (1024-entry LUT), not a square.
--   * Modulator is a sine LFO (also from the LUT), not triangle/sawtooth.
--   * Modulation is applied as a PHASE OFFSET to the carrier (PM), so the
--     resulting waveform is sin(carrier_phase + lfo_sin(line)) -- no
--     integration artefacts, no discontinuities.
--   * One per-field drift accumulator offsets the LFO angle, making the
--     sway pattern travel vertically.  The P12 slider is BIPOLAR: centre
--     = frozen, above centre the flow runs one way (full speed at the
--     top), below centre the other way (full speed at the bottom).  Osc1
--     always follows the slider; S10 selects whether osc2 flows the SAME
--     way or OPPOSITE (counter-flow).
--
-- The two oscillators are layered Woven (over/under alternating at each
-- crossing) or Stacked (S7), both keeping BOTH lines intact, in fully
-- saturated complementary colours.  S8 draws dark full-colour outlines
-- with a highlight on the outside of each bend.  Both waves are drawn as
-- solid crisp-edged bands; S9 Depth adds a drop shadow from the upper
-- ribbon onto the one passing under it, so over/under reads as depth.
--
-- The per-line LFO accumulators are FRAME-LOCKED (reset at field start), so
-- K2/K5 purely set the sway's vertical wavelength.  The swing is a fixed
-- number of PIXELS proportional to that wavelength (constant lean), so it
-- stays visible at every Freq setting; K6 sets the amount.  The
-- ONLY temporal motion is the shared drift accumulator above (slider
-- centre = frozen).
-- S11 selects the waveshape: sine or triangle (carriers and LFOs both),
-- gliding between them over ~0.5 s.
--
-- Resources:
--   1x video_timing_generator
--   2x 20-bit per-line LFO accumulators (step at active-line end)
--   1x per-field gain sequencer (serial mult + divide, both oscs)
--   1x per-line LFO interpolation (sin + cos*frac) + serial PM-offset
--      multiply (both oscs, in hblank)
--   2x video_timing_accumulator (G_W=21, C_HORIZONTAL, lock=1)  : per-pixel carriers
--   2x 20-bit drift accumulators + per-field rate multiply       : sway travel
--   2x sin_cos_full_lut_10x10 (sin+cos)                          : per-osc LFO
--   2x sin_cos_full_lut_10x10                                    : per-osc carrier sine
--   1x sin_cos_full_lut_10x10                                    : K3 hue -> (U,V)
--
-- Hardware contracts (v0.6):
--   * Luma is drawn into 64..765 (black..~75%): full-scale Y clips RGB and
--     kills the chroma at every line's crest, and 1..63 is below black.
--   * The program generates its OWN avid (Cubist's parity-locked version):
--     it starts 2-3 clocks after the source's first avid rise, keeping the
--     hsync->start parity at the source's usual value, and runs exactly the
--     field-latched line width.  The encoders pair Cb/Cr by counting from
--     hsync, so a wandering source avid swaps U/V for a line (thin coloured
--     lines over the bars).  The timing generator is fed this avid too, so
--     the carriers reset and the LFOs step off the clean signal.
--   * Y/U/V are gated to 64/512/512 outside the generated avid.
--   * The sway drift steps once per FIELD -- only on the first vsync edge
--     after active video, since analog vsync serrates (several edges).
--
-- Pipeline (data_in -> data_out):
--   1 clk : video_timing_generator
--   2 clk : video_timing_accumulator (input reg + accum)
--   1 clk : register PM phase (carrier_top + LFO_sin)
--   1 clk : carrier sine LUT lookup, register raw sin & tri
--   1 clk : second sin/tri register (the sine LUT infers as EBR and eats
--           the first register; this one splits EBR read from the output mux)
--   3 clk : sine/triangle glide (diff, partial sums, sum) + 512 -> luma
--   1 clk : band sharpening + shadow delay tap (per oscillator)
--   1 clk : S8 edge outlines + outer-bend highlight (per oscillator)
--   5 clk : layering keyer (select, shadow, B*m partials, scale, max)
--   2 clk : luma-scaled chroma (partial products, then sum)
--   1 clk : luma remap to 64..765 + blanking gate -> output register
--   Total: 19 clk  (sync/avid delay, all modes)
--   (The LFO side chain runs in horizontal blanking: the LFO steps at the
--   end of each active line, and the next line's PM offset lfo*G/512 is
--   ready ~20 clocks later.  G = inc*D/step is computed once per field.)

-- ============================================================================
-- Knob smoother (one per geometry knob).  Pot ADC noise of +/-1 count jumped
-- the picture every frame -- at K1 = 60 one count of Freq moved the bars at
-- the right edge by ~18 px.  Two parts, both stepped once per field (tick):
--   * deadband: the held value h follows the raw knob only when they differ
--     by 5 or more counts (wider than +/-2 ADC flicker peak-to-peak), so
--     steady noise never reaches the picture
--   * glide: the 10.4 output e eases toward h by 1/8 of the gap per field
--     (snapping inside half a count), so a turned knob sweeps smoothly
-- Pipelined so the tick-time update is a plain mux (per-field logic is still
-- timed at the pixel clock).  The first two ticks snap to the knob.
