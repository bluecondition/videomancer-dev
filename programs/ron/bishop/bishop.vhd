-- Bishop v2 — line-buffer wireframe head.
--
-- Architecture:
--   v1 instantiated one DDA + per-pixel hit-tester per edge, in parallel.
--   At ~80 LCs/edge × 50 edges that filled most of HX4K just on edge logic.
--
--   v2 uses a SINGLE shared rasterizer that walks edges sequentially and
--   writes stamps into a 1-bit/pixel dual-bank line buffer (inlined here
--   so we can gate writes — the shared video_line_buffer entity writes
--   every cycle, which kept overwriting fresh stamps with zeros).
--
-- Per-scanline rasterizer timeline (running during the line BEFORE the
-- one being prepared):
--   R_CLEAR  2*hw_r cycles           write 0 across head's x bbox of next-line bank
--                                    (edge update fires once per cycle for first
--                                     N_EDGES cycles, in parallel with clears)
--   R_STAMP  5 + (|slope| + 2*ext + 1) cycles per ACTIVE edge
--                                    write 1 across the edge's row sweep,
--                                    clamped to its own [xlo, xhi]
--   R_IDLE                           wait for next hsync (writes gated off)
--
-- Worst-case HD budget (256 edges, K2 = 7 px, P12 = full size):
--   CLEAR 696 + STAMP ~1220  ≈ 1915 of the 2200 cycles in an HD line.
-- SD (858 cycles/line) cannot hold the full-size mesh; the head is drawn
-- at mesh scale there and the rasterizer runs past the line, so SD shows a
-- cropped, degraded face.  HD is the design target.
--
-- Register map:
--   registers_in(0) = K1 Mouth      (analog close amount)
--   registers_in(1) = K2 Thickness  (top 2 bits → PAD ∈ {0,1,2,3} = 1/3/5/7 px)
--   registers_in(2) = K3 Palette    (top 3 bits = palette index)
--   registers_in(3) = K4 Expression (blend across Neutral..Surprised)
--   registers_in(4) = K5 Noise speed
--   registers_in(5) = K6 Noise spread
--   registers_in(6) = Switches      (bit0 = T7 Fill, bit1 = T8 Eyes open,
--                                    bit2 = T9 noise streaks, bit3 = T10 Bright,
--                                    bit4 = T11 BG-Video)
--   registers_in(7) = P12 Head Size (0 = mesh size, 1023 = ~95% of screen height)
