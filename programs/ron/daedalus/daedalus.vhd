-- daedalus.vhd  (v1.0 -- the picture drawn as a labyrinth)
--
-- Forked from VIDEOSKY, which cut the incoming video into a copper line-screen:
-- an accumulator pair P/Q gives a rotatable, scalable coordinate frame, and the
-- rules are the LEVEL SETS of P (`phase < thickness`).  Level sets can never
-- break, which is why VideoSky's Relief can bow them around the image.
--
-- Daedalus keeps the frame and throws away the level set.  A maze is not a
-- level set, it is a TILING -- so we use the part of the accumulator VideoSky
-- discarded:
--
--   * THE LATTICE IS ALREADY THERE.  acc is 24 bits with 8 fractional bits, so
--     acc(15 downto 8) is the phase within one period -- the SUB-CELL
--     coordinate -- and acc(23 downto 16) is the period INDEX -- the CELL id.
--     VideoSky only ever read the phase byte.  Taking both bytes turns the same
--     two adds per pixel into a full cell grid that rotates with Angle and
--     scales with Pitch for no extra cost.
--
--   * ONE CONTINUOUS LINE (the Truchet weave).  Two tiles, each joining all
--     four edge-midpoint ports IN PAIRS -- N<->W + S<->E, or its mirror
--     N<->E + S<->W.  Because every tile uses every port, each port is always
--     live and always has exactly ONE path arriving from each side: degree 2
--     everywhere, no branching possible, so the ink is a set of unbroken lines
--     that snake around each other at right angles and fill the plane with no
--     gaps and no sparse patches.  (v0.1 hashed each cell EDGE for liveness and
--     drew arms to the live ports.  It connected fine, but independent ports
--     mean degree 0..4 -- T-junctions, crosses, dead ends.  That is a network,
--     not a labyrinth.)
--
--     The paths are STAIRCASES, and they have to be.  With ports at the edge
--     midpoints, a single-turn L from N to W must turn either at the cell
--     CENTRE -- where it collides with the S<->E path -- or at the cell CORNER,
--     where the paths of four cells collide.  Physical Truchet tiles dodge this
--     with quarter-circle arcs that bulge toward the corner without touching
--     it; there is no right-angle equivalent of that arc.  So N<->W runs
--     (128,0)->(128,64)->(64,64)->(64,128)->(0,128), hugging the corner
--     diagonal but reaching neither corner nor centre, and S<->E is its 180
--     degree rotation.  Tile 1 is tile 0 MIRRORED IN u (u -> 256-u, exact about
--     the port at 128), so it costs one negate and a mux rather than a second
--     set of segment tests.
--
--   * UNDER AND OVER (v0.3).  A third tile joins the ports STRAIGHT THROUGH --
--     N<->S and W<->E -- one bar crossing the other, and the under bar BREAKS
--     either side of the over bar and comes back out the far side.  Which bar
--     is on top alternates checkerboard-fashion with cell parity, so a line
--     running through several crossings goes over, under, over -- a woven
--     basket.  The cross pairs all four ports like every other tile, so the
--     degree-2 / one-continuous-line guarantee survives.
--
--   * MEANDER CELLS (v0.4).  The cells are 4x WIDER than they are tall: Q (the
--     column axis) steps at a quarter of P's rate, so every tile stroke that
--     runs along the wide axis is four times longer in pixels than a vertical
--     jog -- long horizontal runs joined by short 90-degree drops, a greek-key
--     meander locked to a grid.  Vertical strokes take a QUARTER width
--     ((w+3)/4) to come out the same thickness in pixels, and Relief's
--     displacement gets the same /4 on the Q axis so the warp stays isotropic.
--
--   * LEGIBLE SCALE (v0.5).  Pitch now spans cells ~164 px .. ~13 px tall (it
--     used to reach 4 px, and the 9.5 px default put parallel runs 2.4 px
--     apart with sub-pixel lines that fell between scan lines).  Line weight is
--     held constant in PIXELS -- the sub-cell width is the pixel weight times
--     step, one small multiply -- so Pitch changes spacing, not thickness.
--     Each stroke is extended by the perpendicular stroke's half-width, so
--     every elbow has a square outer corner instead of a bite out of it.
--
--   * FRACTAL OCTAVES (v0.3, dialled back in v0.4/v0.5).  An octave of the
--     lattice is a BIT-SHIFT of the same warped coordinate: shift the 16-bit
--     integer part left by k and the top byte is the cell id of a lattice 2^k
--     times finer, the bottom byte its sub-cell coordinate, already rescaled.
--     Three nested labyrinths share one accumulator, one warp and one Relief;
--     each pays only its own hash, mirror and segment compares.  They are
--     OR-composited, so the finer weave fills the GAPS between the big lines.
--     Octave k fades in (a per-frame width-cap ramp, no pop) only while its own
--     cells are >= 32 px, so the default shows ONE labyrinth and finer ones
--     appear only as Pitch opens out.  Line weight halves per octave in pixels.
--
--   * RELIEF WARPS THE DOMAIN, NOT THE PATTERN (P12, the headline).  The luma
--     is added to the FULL 16-bit integer part BEFORE it is split into cell id
--     and sub-cell, so the cell boundaries bow along with the strokes and
--     neighbours never disagree about where their shared edge is.  Where luma
--     is smooth the labyrinth drapes; where it FOLDS the coordinate you get a
--     mirrored crease (still continuous); where it is DISCONTINUOUS it tears.
--     Top of the slider folds everywhere at once -- the climax.  v0.5: the full
--     10-bit slider drives the warp (it was 6 bits -- visible steps).
--
-- Renderer: streaming, 12 stages, no line buffer.  Three pixel-rate multiplies
-- (contrast, relief, line weight).  The per-frame angle resolve shares ONE
-- registered 9x10 multiplier, split-operand across vblank cycles.  Rotation
-- and scale pivot on the SCREEN CENTRE: a vblank loop walks the origin back
-- from the centre by the measured half-width/half-height, one DDA step per
-- clock, so no wide multiply is needed.
